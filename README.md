### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m a Petroleum Engineer, as well as a Full Stack Developer.  

IÂ´ve been involved in web development proyects in both front-end and back-end roles, with a little emphasis in this last one. IÂ´m looking forward to keep learning in the developing world, as well as contribute to future proyects with my current knowledge and the skills I have acquired throughout my experience as engineer.

We can get in touch via e-mail at: danielechs@hotmail.com.
